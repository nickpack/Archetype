Basic Grid Set Up
=====================
Archetype uses Semantic.gs for its grid system.

Inside ``_variables.scss`` you'll find these options (shamelessly lifted from semantic.gs):

Number of Columns
------------------
Quite simple really, the number of columns you want in your grid (Default is 12).

> $columns: 12;

Widths
------------------

> $column-width: 60;

> $gutter-width: 20;

> $total-width: 100%;
