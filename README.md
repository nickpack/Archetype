What is Archetype?
=====================
Archetype is my attempt at a flexible front-end framework for developers to get shit done quickly.

Using lessons learned from other popular frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation et al), Archetype is meant to provide developers with all of the boilerplate that is part of the average front-end build but with a more flexible approach to customisation.

I'll expand upon this as I invest more time and effort into the project.
